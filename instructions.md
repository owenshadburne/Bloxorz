# **Instructions**

1) This is a 2D version of the original game
2) The aim of the game is to get the block to fall into the square hole at the end of each stage. There are 6 stages to complete.
3) In order to move the block, you can press the up, down, right, left keys on your keyboard on the bottom right, or you can press the keys "w", "a", "s", "d" preforming the same functions
4) The block orientation will be moving in directions: North, East, South, West
5) When the block moves, it'll take up either one or two spaces depending on whether the block is flat or upright
6) If the block take up one space, it means it is standing upright 
7) If the block is taking up two spaces, it means it is flat on the map
8) In order to win in Bloxorz, the block must be standing upright on the green square, if it is not standing upright on the green square the game will continue until it is satisfied. This means the block should look like a single block on top of the green square.
9) Once you beat the level, the game will go to the starting page, and then you get to pick the next level
10) If you have beaten all 6 levels of the game, Congratulations you're a champion at 2D Bloxorz, if you want to try 3D Bloxorz, go to Cool Math Games and try it yourself

Enjoy!
